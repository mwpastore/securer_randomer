# SecurerRandomer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mwpastore/securer_randomer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mwpastore/securer_randomer)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/securer_randomer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/securer_randomer)

Ruby's SecureRandom prefers OpenSSL over other mechanisms (such as
`/dev/urandom` and `getrandom(2)`). This has recently garnered [some][1]
[criticism][2].

[RbNaCl][3] provides Ruby bindings to [libsodium][4]&mdash;a portable crypto
library and fork of [NaCl][6] by Daniel J. Bernstein that includes hooks to
alternative, OpenSSL-free pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) such as
`getrandom(2)` on modern Linux kernels and `RtlGenRandom()` on Windows.

This gem monkeypatches RbNaCl into SecureRandom and aims to be "bug-for-bug"
compatible with the "stock" implementation of SecureRandom across Ruby
versions. It also provides a bonus "do what I mean" random number method that
can be used instead of Kernel`.rand` and SecureRandom`.random_number`.

## History

This gem started out as a very simple monkeypatch to
SecureRandom`.random_bytes` and grew as I dug deeper. In newer rubies, for
example, you need to patch `.gen_random` instead of `.random_bytes`, and it has
a different calling signature.

Some rubies use OpenSSL for SecureRandom`.random_number` as well, while others
appear to rely on Kernel`.rand`. Addressing this proved to be tricky due to
inconsistencies of these two methods between Ruby implementations and versions.
For example:

* `Kernel.rand(nil)` and `SecureRandom.random_number(nil)` both return a float
  `n` such that `0.0 <= n < 1.0` in Ruby 2.3; but
  `SecureRandom.random_number(nil)` throws an ArgumentError in Ruby 2.2
* Kernel`.rand` with an inverted range (e.g. `0..-10`) returns `nil` in Ruby
  2.2+, but SecureRandom`.random_number` throws an ArgumentError in Ruby 2.2
  and returns a float `n` such that `0.0 <= n < 1.0` in Ruby 2.3

Branching logic, edge cases, and tests started to accumulate so I decided it
was probably a good idea to gemify this!

### Why a monkeypatch?

The concept of monkeypatching in Ruby is a sensitive subject. It has the
potential to break things in unexpected ways and make Ruby code more difficult
to troubleshoot, and it's these kinds of practices that give Ruby (and
Rubyists) a bad name. It was actually way more labor-intensive to write this as
a monkeypatch rather than landing it as a completely separate module. So why?

Simply put, I do not anticipate this gem being a long-term solution! At some
point in the hopefully-near future I would like to see the Ruby core team
acquiesce to community pressure and modify `securerandom.rb` and `random.c` to
not utilize OpenSSL and prefer `getrandom(2)` over `urandom`. And so my goal
was not to write some super-maintainable, standalone piece of software, but
rather a temporary fix that can be easily dropped into an existing project and
easily pulled out at a later date. A monkeypatch is the best way to achieve
this.

## Features

* SecureRandom`.gen_random` (or `.random_bytes`)

  Monkeypatches SecureRandom such that its various formatter methods (`.uuid`,
  `.hex`, `.base64`, `.urlsafe_base64`, and `.random_bytes`) use RbNaCl for random
  byte generation instead of OpenSSL.

* SecureRandom`.random_number`

  Monkeypatches SecureRandom such that it uses SecurerRandomer`.kernel_rand`
  instead of OpenSSL to generate random numbers from numeric types and ranges. It
  is bug-for-bug compatible with "stock" SecureRandom, meaning it "chokes" on the
  same inputs and throws the same exception types.

  If you prefer to use Kernel`.rand` instead of SecurerRandomer`.kernel_rand`,
  add this statement to your bootup process after requiring SecurerRandomer:

  ```ruby
  SecurerRandomer::KERNEL_RAND = Kernel.method(:rand)
  ```

* SecurerRandomer`.kernel_rand`

  A bug-for-bug reimplementation of Kernel`.rand`&mdash;meaning it "chokes" on
  the same inputs and throws the same exception types&mdash;that uses RbNaCl as
  its source of entropy.

* SecurerRandomer`.rand`

  An idealistic, "do what I mean" random number method that accepts a variety of
  inputs and returns what you might expect. Whereas `Kernel.rand(-5.6)` returns
  an integer `n` such that `0 <= n < 5` and `SecureRandom.random_number(-5.6)`
  returns a float `n` such that `0.0 <= n < 1.0`, **`SecurerRandomer.rand(-5.6)`
  returns a float `n` such that `0 >= n > -5.6`**. Whereas `Kernel.rand(10..0)`
  returns `nil` and `SecureRandom.random_number(10..0)` returns a float `n` such
  that `0.0 <= n < 1.0` (in Ruby 2.3), **`SecurerRandomer.rand(10..0)` returns an
  integer `n` such that `10 >= n >= 0`**.

## Installation

Please review the installation instructions for [RbNaCl][3]. You will need to
install either [libsodium][4] or [rbnacl-libsodium][5] before installing this
gem.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'securer_randomer', '~> 0.1.0'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install securer_randomer

## Compatibility

SecurerRandomer has been tested under MRI/YARV versions 1.9.3, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2,
and 2.3, and JRuby 1.7 and 9.0 (both under Oracle Java 8).

## DISCLAIMER

**Use at your own risk!**

I am neither a cryptologist nor a cryptographer. Although I'm fairly confident
in the test suite, serious bugs affecting compatibility, randomness, and
performance may be present. If you're cautious, I would recommend setting
`SecurerRandomer::KERNEL_RAND = Kernel.method(:rand)` as described above.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
